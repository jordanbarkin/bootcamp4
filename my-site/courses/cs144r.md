As networking technologies advance, networks and their applications can operate more and more by themselves without help. For example, based on blockchains, we can develop autonomous systems that will provide forever-improving peer-to-peer services. More specifically, with proper incentives provided to participants to contribute, the network will continue to improve over time.  In this course, we will study core network-related technologies whose interplay will be responsible for these autonomous systems of the future, which range from the Internet of Things (IoT) to decentralized autonomous organizations. These technologies include blockchains, machine learning, IoT, datacenter networking, video-analytics over heterogeneous networks, mobile computing, and homomorphic encryption for cloud computing.  We will first review these core technologies. Following this, we will illustrate novel autonomous applications such as peer-to-peer business models for machine learning systems, including the models themselves and the data on which they operate.  Another application example will be the distributed classification of security attacks, including designing incentives to encourage collaboration in mitigating attacks.  Students will work in pairs on projects related to autonomous technologies and business model experimentation.
