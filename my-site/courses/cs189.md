Building autonomous robotic systems requires understanding how to make robots that observe, reason, and act.  Each component uses many engineering principles: how to fuse, multiple, noisy sensors; how to balance short-term versus long-term goals; how to control oneâ€™s actions and how to coordinate with others. This year theme will be "Robots Roam the Halls", where we will focus on kinect-based robots that move in the SEAS buildings, to do applications like navigating, map building, and interacting with people. The class format will have a mixed lecture and lab format, and have a final project component.
